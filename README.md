# About Me:
I’m a student at the Military University of Technology, passionate about low-level and embedded systems. I don’t just aim to make things work—I strive to make them efficient, smart, and elegant. I love optimizing code and hardware, pushing the limits of performance in low-end systems. My goal is to create hardware and software that don’t just function, but reshape the way technology works.
